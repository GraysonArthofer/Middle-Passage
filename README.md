# Middle-Passage
Historical Analysis Project
In this project, I will uncover some of the numbers behind the Trans-atlantic slave trade (TAST), also known as the middle passage, that brought African slaves to the Americas. The middle passage is reported to have forcibly migrated over 10 million Africans to the Americas over a roughly 3 century time span. Many aspects of the TAST is little known by most people, such as the countries that constituted this network of slave ships, the regions from which the slaves were taken, and the number of slaves captured from Africa.
